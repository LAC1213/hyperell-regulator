r"""
Frobenius polynomials at good primes, in bulk.

An `L`-function needs the Euler factor at every good prime below a bound,
and for a genus 2 curve that is thousands of `p`-adic Frobenius
computations.  Sage will do them one at a time through its own
``hypellfrob``; this module hands the whole list to David Harvey's
``hypellfrob`` as a single batched, threaded job, so the per-call overhead
is paid once and the primes run concurrently.

The mathematics is unchanged.  The external program returns the matrix of
Frobenius on `H^1_{\mathrm{dR}}` modulo `p^N`, and the characteristic
polynomial is lifted to `\ZZ[x]` exactly as
:meth:`~sage.schemes.hyperelliptic_curves.hyperelliptic_finite_field.HyperellipticCurve_finite_field.frobenius_polynomial_matrix`
does: reduce `a_g, \dots, a_0` into the symmetric range mod `p^N`, with `N`
Kedlaya's bound, and recover `a_{2g},\dots,a_{g+1}` from the functional
equation `a_{2g-i} = a_i q^{g-i}`.

The program is built from ``hypellfrob-threaded`` and ships with this
package: ``sage -pip install`` compiles it and puts it in
``hyperell_regulator/bin/euler``, and in a checkout ``make`` in that
directory does the same job.  It is looked for at ``$HYPELLFROB_EULER``
first, then inside the package, then in the source tree.
When it is missing, or declines a prime, that prime falls back to Sage, so
results never depend on whether it is built -- only the speed does.

def odd_model(f):
    r"""
    A monic, integral, **odd** degree model of `y^2 = f(x)`, or ``None``.

    The fast path needs `Q` monic of odd degree `2g+1`; `4f + h^2` has even
    degree whenever `h` has degree `g+1`, and the only even degree routine
    available is linear in `p`.  An odd degree model exists exactly when the
    curve has a rational Weierstrass point, and then

    .. math:: u \mapsto u^{\deg f}\,f(r + 1/u)

    moves that point `r` to infinity and drops the degree by one, the
    coefficient of `u^{\deg f}` being `f(r) = 0`.  It is an isomorphism over
    `\QQ`, so the characteristic polynomial of Frobenius is unchanged at
    every prime where both models are good; at the finitely many primes
    dividing the scalings, the program declines and the caller falls back.

    The result is then made monic by `x \mapsto cx`, `y \mapsto c^{(d-1)/2}y`,
    and integral by `x \mapsto x/m^2`, `y \mapsto y/m^d`.

def frobenius_polynomials(f, primes, nthreads=None):

    `\{p : \text{charpoly of Frobenius on } y^2 = f(x) \bmod p\}`.

    ``f`` is a polynomial over `\QQ` with integral coefficients; ``primes``
    are the primes to do, which must be of good reduction.  Any prime the
    batched program declines falls back to Sage.

    An even degree ``f`` is replaced by :func:`odd_model` where one exists,
    since only odd degree has the `O(\sqrt p)` path; without a rational
    Weierstrass point it goes through the even degree routine, which is
    correct but linear in `p`, so an even degree curve with no such point
    cannot reach the same speed.
