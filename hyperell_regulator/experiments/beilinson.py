Beilinson regulator determinants from torsion points.

For each curve in ``same_component_results.json`` (written by
:mod:`hyperell_regulator.components`) this looks for a triple of
distinct rational points `P, Q, R` such that

1. `[P] - [R]` and `[Q] - [R]` are torsion in the Jacobian,
2. `(P, R)` and `(Q, R)` each reduce to a smooth point of the *same*
   irreducible component of the special fibre at *every* prime, and
3. no two of `P, Q, R` are hyperelliptic conjugates,

then ranks the triples by cut conditioning and evaluates the
`3 \times 3` regulator determinant of Corollary "3x3 matrix".

When moving `R` to infinity would also move `P` or `Q` there, all three
points are kept affine instead. The logarithmic weight is then
`m_P = (x-x(P))/(x-x(R))`, and similarly for `Q`.

The construction (infinity normalization)
=======================================

With `\O^+ := R` moved to `[0:1:0]`, a torsion point `P^+ \in C(\QQ)` of order
`n` gives `n P^+ - n \O^+ = \div(f^+)`; applying the hyperelliptic involution
`F` gives `f^- := f^+ \circ F` with `\div(f^-) = n P^- - n \O^-`.  Setting
`\varphi := f^+ f^-`, so that
`\div(\varphi) = n(P^+ + P^- - \O^+ - \O^-)`, the cycle

.. MATH::

    \alpha_P = (\Delta C, \varphi \circ \pi_1) - (\Gamma_F, \varphi \circ \pi_1)
      - (\{P^+\} \times C, \psi \circ \pi_2) + (\{P^-\} \times C, \psi \circ \pi_2)
      - (C \times \{\O^+\}, \psi \circ \pi_1) + (C \times \{\O^-\}, \psi \circ \pi_1)

with `\psi := f^+/f^-` defines a class in `\CH^2(C \times C, 1)`.  Since
`\div(x - x(P)) = P^+ + P^- - \O^+ - \O^-`, one has
`(x - x(P))^n = c\,\varphi` for some `c \in \QQ^\times`, whence the regulator

.. MATH::

    \langle \reg(\alpha_P), \delta_{ij} \rangle
      = \frac{1}{2\pi i} \int_{\CC} \frac{\log|m_P(z)|}{|f(z)|} d_{ij}(z)\,
        dz\, d\overline z + \log|c|\, a_{ij},

`m_P` being the minimal polynomial of `x(P)` over `\QQ` -- here `x - x(P)`,
since `P` is rational.  The `\log|c| a_{ij}` terms are killed by row
operations against the third column, which is why the matrix below has the
`1/|f|` integrals as its last column and needs no knowledge of `c`.

What is computed
================

For `d_{11} = 1`, `d_{12} = \Re(z)`, `d_{22} = |z|^2`, the matrix

.. MATH::

    \begin{pmatrix}
      \int \frac{\log|m_P|}{|f|} d_{11} & \int \frac{\log|m_Q|}{|f|} d_{11} & \int \frac{d_{11}}{|f|} \\
      \int \frac{\log|m_P|}{|f|} d_{12} & \int \frac{\log|m_Q|}{|f|} d_{12} & \int \frac{d_{12}}{|f|} \\
      \int \frac{\log|m_P|}{|f|} d_{22} & \int \frac{\log|m_Q|}{|f|} d_{22} & \int \frac{d_{22}}{|f|}
    \end{pmatrix}

and its determinant, by the Stokes regulator
(:func:`hyperell_regulator.regulator.regulator_stokes`): the columns at `P`
and `Q` come from functions with divisor `n P - n\O`, the third is the period
vector.  A curve whose cut system the Stokes method cannot build is reported
and skipped -- nothing here integrates over `\CC`.
If the determinant is non-zero, Beilinson's conjecture predicts it is a
rational multiple of `(2\pi i) c^+(C) c^-(C) L'''(\wedge^2 C, 1)`; the periods
`c^\pm` are reported alongside, the cached standard `L`-value is computed when needed for the comparison.

Caveats
=======

* Condition 2 is decided by :mod:`hyperell_regulator.reduction`, which
  cannot answer at `p = 2`.
  A triple whose pairs are *undecided* at 2 is reported as such and skipped by
  default; pass ``allow_undecided=True`` to use it anyway.
* Triples are pairwise non-conjugate: conjugate `P,Q` give equal weights,
  while a point conjugate to `R` gives the constant weight 1.
* Integrality of `\alpha_P` -- the existence of a suitable `c` -- is exactly
  what condition 2 is a proxy for.  It is not verified independently here.

    r"""
    The column `\bigl(\int \log|x - x(P)|\,d_{ij}/|f|\bigr)_{ij}`, by the
    Stokes regulator rather than by quadrature over `\CC`.

    The Stokes method needs a function whose divisor is `N A - N B`, and
    `x - x(P)` instead has divisor `P^+ + P^- - \O^+ - \O^-`.
    We use `f^+` with `\div(f^+) = n P^+ - n\O^+`, the function defining
    the cycle `\alpha_P`, and `f^- = f^+ \circ \iota`.  Pointwise,

    .. math:: \log|f^+| + \log|f^-|
              = \log|\operatorname{N}(f^+)|
              = n\log|x - x(P)| - \log|c| ,

    where `(x - x(P))^n = c\,f^+f^-`.  The differential weights are
    invariant under the hyperelliptic involution `\iota`, so the integrals
    weighted by `\log|f^+|` and `\log|f^-|` agree.  Consequently the column
    is `\frac{2}{n}` times the `\log|f^+|` regulator plus
    `\frac{\log|c|}{n}` times the periods.  The `\log|c|` term is the same
    one the third column removes by row operations, but it costs nothing to
    put it in and makes this column equal the plane integrator's outright.

    r"""
    Find the first usable triple for one curve and compute its regulator
    determinant.  Returns a dictionary, with ``"status"`` saying what happened.

    The regulator is the Stokes one throughout.  It needs the order of each
    torsion point, to build a function with divisor `n P - n\O`; a curve
    without one, or whose cut system will not close, is reported in
    ``"status"`` and skipped rather than integrated over `\CC`.

    ``geom_simple`` restricts to curves whose Jacobian is geometrically
    simple, which is LMFDB's ``is_simple_geom``.

    ``digits`` is the `L`-value's precision and ``reg_digits`` the
    regulator's. The default regulator uses float64 (``reg_digits=None``);
    the L-value uses fifteen digits. Arbitrary precision is explicit and
    failures never silently switch implementations.

    Which triple is integrated is decided by :func:`rank_triples`, on the
    conditioning of the cut systems it would need; only ``tries`` of them are
    integrated, the best first, and one is the default.  Ordering by torsion
    order instead -- which is what this did -- picks arbitrarily among triples
    that tie, and on LMFDB 249.a.249.1 that is the difference between a `Q`
