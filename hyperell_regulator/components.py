r"""
For genus 2 curves of small conductor whose Jacobian is simple, list the pairs
of known rational points that reduce to a smooth point of the *same*
irreducible component of the special fibre at *every* prime.

Run the whole enumeration with::

    sage -python -m hyperell_regulator.components

or, from a session, :func:`enumerate_all`.  The LMFDB rows and the answers are
cached under :func:`hyperell_regulator.paths.data_dir`.

Reduction is decided by :mod:`hyperell_regulator.reduction` (cluster pictures
at odd primes, Liu's algorithm at 2).  Recall the convention there: the special fibre is that of the
*stable* model, so a point landing on one of the chains of `\mathbb{P}^1`'s of
the minimal regular model counts as reducing to a node, not to a smooth point.

At a prime of good reduction the special fibre is smooth and irreducible, so
every pair trivially qualifies; only the bad primes need testing.  At `p = 2`
cluster pictures do not apply, so if 2 is a bad prime the verdict is reported as
*undecided* rather than guessed.

Data
====

Curves, equations, simplicity and rational points come from LMFDB, tables
``g2c_curves`` and ``g2c_ratpts``; the fields used are ``cond``, ``eqn``,
``is_simple_base`` and ``rat_pts``.  LMFDB rate-limits bulk API access (it
starts serving a CAPTCHA), so the data is read from a local JSON file rather
than fetched on the fly.  See :func:`fetch_lmfdb` for the shape of that file
and a best-effort fetcher, and :func:`load_curves` for the reader.

Points at infinity
==================

LMFDB gives points in the weighted projective coordinates `(X : Y : Z)` of
weights `(1, g+1, 1)`, so an affine point is `x = X/Z`, `y = Y/Z^{g+1}`, and
`Z = 0` is a point at infinity.  ``reduce_point`` needs affine coordinates, so
:func:`affine_model` first moves every point into the affine chart by the
substitution `u = 1/(x-a)`, `v = y/(x-a)^{g+1}` for a suitable integer `a`.
This is an isomorphism over `\QQ`, so it changes no answer -- and where a pair
is affine both before and after, the two computations are compared as a check.

    r"""
    Fetch the LMFDB rows needed by this script into ``path``, merging with
    whatever is already cached.

    Query budget
    ============

    ``_limit`` is capped at 100 by LMFDB, so 100 rows per request is the floor.
    Three things keep the count near it:

    * ``is_simple_geom`` (or ``is_simple_base``) is applied **server-side**, so
      a page of 100 is 100 *qualifying* curves rather than the ~54 that
      client-side filtering left usable.
    * points are requested only for labels not already cached.
    * ``g2c_ratpts`` has no conductor column, so it has to be scanned in order;
      the offset reached is remembered in ``_scan_state.json`` next to the
      cache, so extending an existing cache resumes instead of rescanning from
      0.  Delete that file to force a full rescan.

    So a first fetch of 100 curves costs about 3 requests and extending it
    costs about 3 more, against 101 for the naive label-by-label version and
    ~4-6 for the previous one.

    LMFDB has no working range operator on ``cond`` (``cond=lt400`` and
    ``cond=277..400`` both 404), so ``max_cond`` is still applied client-side;
    that is free, since the curve rows are sorted by conductor anyway.  LMFDB
    also serves a CAPTCHA to clients that hammer it, so this identifies itself,
    sleeps ``pause`` seconds between requests and backs off on a challenge.

def lmfdb_label(C, pause=6, email="acampo@ihes.fr", verbose=True):
    r"""
    The LMFDB label(s) of the genus 2 curve ``C``, looked up by invariants.

    Genus 2 curves are isomorphic exactly when their *absolute* Igusa
    invariants agree, so those are the right key: Sage's
    ``absolute_igusa_invariants_wamelen`` is computed both for ``C`` and for
    each LMFDB candidate's ``eqn`` and the two compared.  (Sage's
    ``igusa_clebsch_invariants`` are *not* directly comparable with LMFDB's
    ``igusa_clebsch_inv``: they differ by a weighted scaling -- for
    277.a.277.1 by `\lambda^2 = -4` -- and LMFDB's ``g2_inv`` uses yet another
    normalisation.  Comparing absolute invariants computed the same way on both
    sides side-steps all of that.)

    Candidates are drawn by ``abs_disc``, the absolute value of Liu's minimal
    discriminant, which is a reliable key -- unlike the conductor, which PARI's
    ``genus2red`` sometimes reports only away from 2 (see 388.a.776.1, where it
    gives 97 rather than 388).  The conductor is used as a fallback.

    Returns the list of matching labels; a single match is the normal case.

    about `a`, reversed; `G` is integral of degree exactly `2g+2` as soon as
    `F(a) \ne 0`, and `u = 0` is the image of `x = \infty`.  We return the
    curve `v^2 = G(u)` (i.e. ``f = G``, ``h = 0``) together with the

    ``a`` is chosen integral with `F(a) \ne 0` and distinct from every finite

    r"""
    An isomorphic model `v^2 = G(u)` with `\deg G` odd, together with the map
    on points, or ``None`` if `F = 4f + h^2` has no rational root.

    Sage's genus 2 Jacobian arithmetic (Mumford representation) needs a single
    rational point at infinity, i.e. an odd degree model.  A rational root `r`
    of `F` is a rational Weierstrass point; moving it to infinity by
    `u = 1/(x-r)`, `v = Y/(x-r)^{g+1}` with `Y = 2y + h(x)` drops the degree of
    `F` by the multiplicity of `r`, giving `\deg G = 2g+1`.

    Returns ``(D, phi, r)`` where ``D`` is the Sage hyperelliptic curve
    `v^2 = G(u)` and ``phi`` sends an affine `(x, y)` on ``C``, or the string
    ``"infinity"``, to a point of ``D``.

def divisor_class_order(C, P, Q, primes=30):
    r"""
    The order of `[P] - [Q]` in `J(\QQ)`, or ``+Infinity`` if it is not
    torsion, or ``None`` if it could not be computed.

    Torsion of `J(\QQ)` injects into `J(\GF{p})` at a prime `p` of good
    reduction, so the order of a torsion class divides
    `m = \gcd_p \# J(\GF{p})`.  We compute that gcd over the good primes up
    to ``primes``, then test the divisors of `m` in increasing order; the first
    that kills the class is the order, and if none does the class is not
    torsion.
