r"""
The standard `L`-function of a genus 2 curve over `\QQ`.

For a genus 2 curve `C/\QQ` the *standard* motive is the degree 5 piece

.. MATH::

    \mathrm{std} = \ker\bigl(\wedge^2 h^1(C) \to h^2(C) = \QQ(-1)\bigr),

so that `L(\wedge^2 h^1, s) = L(\mathrm{std}, s)\,\zeta(s-1)`.  This is the
`L`-function that appears in Beilinson's conjecture for `K_2` of a genus 2
curve, and the one :mod:`hyperell_regulator.experiments.beilinson` compares
the regulator against.

What is computed here
=====================

* :func:`wedge2_euler_factor` -- the degree 6 Euler factor of `\wedge^2 h^1`
  from the degree 4 Euler factor of `h^1`;

* :class:`CurveLFunction` -- `L(C,s)` itself, degree 4; and
  :class:`StandardLFunction` -- the Euler factors (good ones batched through
  :mod:`~hyperell_regulator.frobenius`, bad ones from the cluster picture of
  :mod:`hyperell_regulator.reduction`, which supplies the monodromy
  filtration that the `h^1` factor alone does not determine), the conductor,
  the Dirichlet coefficients, a numerical check of the functional equation,
  and values and derivatives at `s = 1`;

* :func:`standard_lvalue` -- the convenience wrapper returning
  `L''(\mathrm{std}, 1)` together with everything that went into it.

EXAMPLES::

    sage: from hyperell_regulator.lfunction import StandardLFunction
    sage: from hyperell_regulator.reduction import HyperellipticCurveWithReduction
    sage: R.<x> = ZZ[]
    sage: C = HyperellipticCurveWithReduction(x^5 + x^3 + 1)
    sage: L = StandardLFunction(C, bad_factors={2: None})  # 2 is bad and even
    sage: L.euler_factor(53).degree()
    3

:func:`standard_lvalue` runs the whole computation -- Euler factors,
conductor, functional equation check, `L''(\mathrm{std}, 1)` -- in one call,
and is what the experiments use.

    The *standard* `L`-function of a genus 2 curve `C/\QQ`: the degree 5 motive

    .. MATH::

        \mathrm{std} = \ker\bigl(\wedge^2 h^1(C) \to h^2(C) = \QQ(-1)\bigr),

    so that `L(\wedge^2 h^1, s) = L(\mathrm{std}, s)\,\zeta(s-1)` and, locally,
    `P_p^{\wedge^2}(T) = P_p^{\mathrm{std}}(T)\,(1 - pT)` -- the `\QQ(-1)`
    summand being unramified everywhere with Frobenius `p`.

    Euler factors
    =============

    The `h^1` factors `P_p(T) = \det(1 - \mathrm{Frob}_p T \mid V_\ell^{I_p})`
    come from PARI's ``lfungenus2``, at good and bad primes alike.

    At a **good** prime `P_p` has degree 4 and `P_p^{\wedge^2}` is its
    alternating square, :func:`wedge2_euler_factor`.

    At a **bad** prime this is not enough: `(\wedge^2 V)^{I} \ne \wedge^2(V^I)`,
    so the `h^1` factor alone does not determine the `\wedge^2` one.  What is
    missing is the monodromy filtration, and that is what the cluster picture
    supplies.  For `C` semistable at `p` write `t` for the toric rank, so that
    `V_\ell` has graded pieces `U` (weight 0, dimension `t`), `B` (weight 1,
    dimension `2a`, `a = 2 - t`) and `U' \cong U^*(-1)` (weight 2), with the
    monodromy `N` killing `U \oplus B` and mapping `U'` isomorphically onto
    `U`.  Then `V^I = \ker N = U \oplus B`, and
    `(\wedge^2 V)^I = \ker N_{\wedge^2}` works out as follows.

    * `t = 0`: `A` has good reduction, `V^I = V`, and the alternating square is
      the full degree 6 factor.

    * `t = 1`: `\ker N_{\wedge^2} = (U \wedge B) \oplus \wedge^2 B \oplus
      (U \wedge U')` has dimension `2 + 1 + 1 = 4`, giving

      .. MATH::

          P_p^{\wedge^2}(T) = A(\gamma T)\,(1 - b_2 T)\,(1 - \gamma^2 p T),

      where `U(T) = 1 - \gamma T` is the toric factor, `A(T) = 1 + b_1T + b_2T^2`
      the abelian one (so `b_2 = p`), and `\gamma = \pm 1`.

    * `t = 2`: `\ker N_{\wedge^2} = \wedge^2 U \oplus
      \ker(U \otimes U' \to \wedge^2 U)` has dimension `1 + 3 = 4`, giving

      .. MATH::

          P_p^{\wedge^2}(T) = (1 - u_2 T)(1 - pT)^2(1 - u_2 p T),
          \qquad u_2 = \det(\mathrm{Frob} \mid U) = \pm 1.

    The toric factor is read off the Frobenius action on
    `H_1` of the dual graph, via ``Cluster.homology_of_special_fibre``; the
    abelian factor is then `P_p / U(T)`.

    Tame but not semistable: potentially good reduction
    ===================================================

    If `C` is tame at `p` but not semistable, `V_\ell` still becomes
    unramified-up-to-monodromy only over the minimal semistabilising extension
    `K`, of degree `e` prime to `p`.  Inertia acts through the finite cyclic
    quotient `\Phi = I_p/I_K`, and being of order prime to `p` it acts
    *semisimply*.

    When the potential stable reduction has **toric rank 0** -- Liu's types
    (I) and (V), i.e. `J` acquires good reduction over `K` -- the monodromy `N`
    vanishes, so `V^{I_K} = V` and `V^{I_p} = V^{\Phi}`.  Writing
    `V = V^{I} \perp V'` for the splitting into the trivial and the non-trivial
    `\Phi`-isotypic parts (orthogonal for the Weil pairing, since `\Phi`
    preserves it), the cross terms carry no invariants because `(V')^{I} = 0`:

    .. MATH::

        (\wedge^2 V)^{I} = \wedge^2\bigl(V^{I}\bigr) \oplus
                           \bigl(\wedge^2 V'\bigr)^{I}.

    Two sub-cases are then completely determined by `P_p` alone.

    * `f_p = 0`: `V' = 0`, `V^I = V`, and the factor is the full degree 6
      alternating square, as in the semistable `t = 0` case.

    * `f_p = 2`: `\dim V' = 2`, so `(\wedge^2 V')^{I} = \wedge^2 V'` is a line
      on which Frobenius acts by `\det(F \mid V)/\det(F \mid V^I) = p^2/d`,
      where `d = \det(F \mid V^I)` is the leading coefficient of `P_p`.  The
      polarisation is nondegenerate on each summand, so the class `\omega` of
      `\QQ(-1)` is `\omega_1 + \omega_2` with both parts non-zero; being a
      Frobenius eigenvector of eigenvalue `p` forces `d = p`.  Hence

      .. MATH::

          P_p^{\wedge^2}(T) = (1 - pT)^2, \qquad
          P_p^{\mathrm{std}}(T) = 1 - pT.

    `f_p` odd cannot occur here: `\Phi` acts trivially on
    `\wedge^4 V = \QQ_\ell(-2)`, so `\det(\sigma \mid V') = 1`, and `V'` is
    symplectic, hence even dimensional.  `f_p = 4` is not implemented: with
    `V^I = 0` the answer depends on the eigenvalues of `\Phi` on `V`, which
    `P_p = 1` does not record.

    Toric rank `> 0` together with `e > 1` -- potentially multiplicative but
    not semistable, Liu's types (II), (III), (IV), (VI), (VII) with a non-trivial
    `\Phi` -- needs `(\ker N_{\wedge^2})^{\Phi}` and is not implemented either.

    Assumptions, all checked at runtime
    ===================================

    * `p` odd, and `C` either semistable at `p` or tame with potentially good
      reduction -- otherwise the prime must be supplied in ``bad_factors``.  In
      particular `p = 2` always needs an override, cluster pictures needing odd
      residue characteristic.
    * Frobenius acts on `H_1` of the dual graph with `M^2 = 1`, so that its
      eigenvalues are `\pm 1`.  This is what makes the `t = 2` bookkeeping above
      valid; a higher-order graph automorphism raises.
    * `(1 - pT)` divides `P_p^{\wedge^2}` exactly.

    The real check on all of this is the functional equation: see
    :meth:`check_functional_equation`.  A wrong bad factor or conductor will
    show up there.

        Replaces a hand-tuned heuristic (`\sim\mathrm{digits}\cdot\sqrt N`)
        that was checked to undershoot substantially: at `\mathrm{digits}=15`
        on a conductor `3\times10^7` curve it supplied `20713`-`82555`

        (``#an = ... < 160925, results may be imprecise``) confirms the

        recorded as achieved without actually being achieved.

        Uses ``gp.eval('default(realprecision, ...)')`` to set the precision
