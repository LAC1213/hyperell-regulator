r"""Tests for the batched Frobenius path and the two `L`-functions.

The Euler factors at good primes now come from David Harvey's
``hypellfrob``, handed the whole list of primes as one threaded job rather
than one prime at a time.  The mathematics must be unchanged, so the first
thing checked is that the batched factors are *identical* to Sage's, prime
by prime; and that removing the program falls back to Sage rather than
failing.

An even degree model -- which is what `4f + h^2` gives when `h` has degree
`g+1` -- is replaced by its odd model when the curve has a rational
Weierstrass point to move to infinity, and otherwise goes through a routine
linear in `p`: correct, but not the same speed.

Then the two `L`-functions.  `L(C,s)` is checked against PARI's own
``lfungenus2`` -- coefficients and value both -- since that is an
independent implementation of the same object.  Finally, that asking for
more digits actually delivers them: returning ``RR(pari.lfun(...))`` caps
every value at 53 bits however high PARI's working precision is set, which
is the bug the arbitrary-precision path had to fix.
