r"""Tests for the regulator package.

Two curves, chosen so that between them they exercise every chart the Stokes
integrator has:

* `y^2 = x^5 + (1+x)^2` with `\varphi = y+1+x`, degree 5, `P = (0,-1)` and
  `Q = \infty` both totally ramified.  `B \neq 0`, so `x` separates the fibre
  and the end legs use the `x`- and `\tau`-charts.
* `y^2 = x(x^4+x+1)` with `\varphi = x`, degree 2, `P = (0,0)`.  `B = 0`, so
  `\varphi` factors through `x`, the cover polynomial is a perfect square and
  every ramification point of `\varphi` is a Weierstrass point of the curve:
  the `y`-chart.
* `y^2 = x(x-1)(x^3+x+1)` with `\varphi = x/(x-1)`, degree 2, `P = (0,0)` and
  `Q = (1,0)` -- a *finite* `Q`, so the leg out to `w = \infty` closes on a
  finite Weierstrass point instead of on the point at infinity.  Infinity is
  then an ordinary critical value, `\varphi(\infty) = A(\infty) = 1`, which
  the `\tau`-chart must handle at finite `w` as well.
* `y^2 = -4x^5+13x^4-18x^3+15x^2-6x+1` with
  `\varphi = \tfrac12(x^3-x^2-x) + \tfrac12(2-x)y`, degree 7, from
  `P = (1,1)` to `Q = \infty`: LMFDB 249.a.249.1, and the first cover here
  taken from a curve rather than written down.  The model is not monic, `B`
  has a zero -- so the fibre pinches in `x` over `w = A(2) = 1` although
  `\varphi` is unramified there -- and `P` is a sevenfold point, which
  ``np.roots`` cannot place to better than a hundredth.
* `y^2 = u^6 + 4u^5 + 4u^4 + 2u^3 + 1` with `\varphi` of degree 7 from
  `P = (-1, 0)` to one of the two points at infinity: the same curve as
  above in an *even* degree model, where infinity is two points rather than
  one Weierstrass point, `\tau = 1/x` rather than `x^{-1/2}`, and
  `\varphi` has a pole of order `N` at one of them and none at the other --
  its regular value there being a critical value with two sheets running
  into it.
* `y^2 = x^5 - 5x^3 + 4x` with `\varphi = x`, and
  `y^2 = x(x-1)(x^3+3x^2-4x+1)` with `\varphi = x/(x-1)`: both have all their
  critical values real, with `\varphi(P) = 0` in the middle of them, so no
  path of straight segments through them is embedded and the cut system has
  to route the closing step round a detour.  The second is finite-`Q` as
  well.

What is checked: the Stokes method against the plane integrator, the fast and
slow forms against each other, the arbitrary-precision path against itself at
two precisions, the structural identities the construction rests on, and the
helpers.
